I am a TUV SUD Certified Functional Safety Engineer with a Master's degree in Automotive Mechatronics from Cranfield University. With three years of experience in safety-critical environments spanning the robotics and automotive sectors, I specialize in applying quality and safety principles across the entire product lifecycle.

I am deeply passionate about the future of automotive technology, particularly in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. My expertise is grounded in functional safety standards like ISO 26262, ensuring the development of robust and reliable systems.

My GitHub repositories reflect this focus, featuring a combination of personal and academic work. A key project involved leading the end-to-end safety lifecycle for an ASIL-D Steer-by-Wire (SbW) system, where I conducted HARA and FMEA and developed test cases using MATLAB/Simulink and IPG CarMaker. I am currently channeling my V&V and functional safety skills into developing innovative and safe ADAS features.
